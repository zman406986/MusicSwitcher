Explanation,Mod explanation,Text,"This mod allows you to mix-and-match custom music with vanilla music, with sample tracks from [Honkai:Star Rail] as the default custom music. 

You can replace existing tracks, or add your more to a shuffle. Refer to the readme file in the mod folder for a detailed guide.

If you are a modder, you can also add combat music for your mod's faction and let Music Switcher play it, see the readme file for details.",,,,,Campaign Music

Combat Note,Note,Text,"[Vanilla] combat music is pretty much ambient silence. 
[Faction Specific] adapts combat music to the enemy faction you are facing, but each faction only has one track.
[Generic Combat Music] does not include any faction specific music above, and instead plays a few selected combat tracks, regardless of what faction you are fighting with.
[Faction + Generic Shuffle] combines the above for more variantion.
[Entire sample playlist] can play any track at random, regardless of what faction you are fighting with.
